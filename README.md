# Country-Info
Worked alongside a fellow engineering student to create a program informing the user about a chosen country. This includes certain population statistics such as the graph of the mean population over two chosen years. This program also graphs the total amount of endangered animals within a country's subregion while also showing the total amount of endangered animals within that country.

This has been done by desgning a terminal-based Python app which selects, imports, and manipulates a set of data using numpy arrays. We processed user input data and displayed data using matplotlib.
